I'd be happy to help! It looks like you might have a typo in your message ("hello wor;d"). 

Could you clarify what you'd like me to help you create in your HTML file? For example:
- A basic HTML page structure?
- A "Hello World" page?
- Something else?

Please let me know what you'd like to build!

    <h1>Hello World</h1>
